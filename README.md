## Description
Whendor is a web app designed to increase the reach that street vendors have. Whendor doesn't just take food vendors into account, it makes sure that all types of street vendors have a voice. Street vendors will be able to create a profile where they can post their location, business hours, and contact information. Once a profile is created, it will be available for customers to view and decide if they'd like to buy from a vendor. Customers are able to create an account and then browse for vendors by category (the type of product that a vendor sells).

## Project Vision Statement
The Minimum Viable Product is an application where the user will be able to choose either the role of a customer (user) or vendor and a user will able to browse for vendors that fall under specific categories.
- **Account Creation/Profile:** As a user, a person will be able to create a profile by providing their name, email, a username, and a password. On the user profile itself, they will be able to upload a profile picture and follow different vendors. Users can also view vendors' profiles and leave ratings (ratings not necessary). Besides providing the same information as users in the account creation process, vendors will also provide their business name, category of product, location, contact information, and work hours.
- **Home Page:** A vendor will be featured and a search bar will be provided.
- **Navigation Bar:** Will allow users to navigate the application.
- **Categories:** Allows users to refine their search for vendors by selecting specific categories and subcategories.Can be accessed by tapping on **Vendors** in the navigation bar. 
- **About Us Page:** Short amount of information about the team.

## History
NYC is a rich and prosperous city that offers almost anything to consumers; multiple shops, restaurants, and department stores are within walking distance from a buyer. Oftentimes, street vendors are overlooked and taken for granted. Some of these street vendors are the true hidden gems of NYC â€” offering great products for a cheap price. Street vendors are also extremely hard working, it takes courage to go out and sell on the street, and they deserve more than what they get.
