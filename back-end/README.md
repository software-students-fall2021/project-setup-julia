# Whendor Back-End
To run:

1. To use JWT Authentication and connect to MongoDB, get a copy of `back-end\.env` from a team member.
2. If using with the Whendor React front-end, start the front-end first.
3. In your local machine's terminal, navigate to .../back-end/
4. If you haven't before, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies to build the app.
5. Run `npm start` to start the back-end server. 
You can now make requests to the back-end through the React front-end.
